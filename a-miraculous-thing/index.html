      <h1>A Miraculous Thing</h1>
<p class="subtitle">February 15, 2008</p>

<p>Yesterday, I was pulling out of a parking lot in my 2000 Honda Accord. In front of me was a Honda Civic that looked to be from the late 80’s to early 90’s.</p>

<p>And then, something amazing happened. <strong>Our blinkers synchronized!</strong></p>

<p>For the half a minute or so we were both waiting for a right turn, our blinkers blinked in unison. Never deviating from the pattern, or moving apart as per usual. I always look at the blinkers at the vain hope that one day, just this will occur.</p>

<p>I was so gobsmacked I forgot to memorize the car’s plate numbers! It was going the same way as I for a bit, so I followed just behind, and contemplated following the car to its destination but decided against it. After all, what the hell am I going to do? Go up to the driver and introduce myself?</p>

<p>Instead, I will just be content in the knowledge that for me, there is a car out there that blinks just like mine.</p>
