  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="/images/Typhoon3.jpg" alt="A Classic of Soviet Engineering" />In one of my sailing classes, one of my shipmates was a Russian ex-navyman who served on a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_class#Delta_IV_.28Project_667BDRM.2C_Delfin.29_7_boats">Delta IV class</a> (designated &#8220;Delfin&#8221; or Dolphin in Russian) nuclear submarine. Once he realized I spoke Russian we got to chatting more about his experiences on the submarines and he told me the amusing story of the genesis of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhoon_class">Typhoon-class submarine</a> (that&#8217;s the NATO designation, the Russians call it &#8220;Akula&#8221;&#8211;Shark).<p />Those of you have watched or read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_hunt_for_red_october">The Hunt for Red October</a> would be familiar with the Soviet-built Typhoon, it was the <em>Red October </em>itself. It also has a rather distinctive wide and flat appearance.<p />In the late 70s and early 80s, the workhorses of the Soviet nuclear sub fleet were earlier iterations of the Delta class (Delta I through III). The world was moving from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid-propellant_rocket">liquid-fueled</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_fuel_rocket">solid-fueled</a> rockets but apparently the latter take up more space that was available on the Deltas. The Americans were designing and putting out bigger subs.<p />When faced with this dilemma the Soviets thought about it for a while, then put two Delta class hulls next to each other, wrapped them with a shared skin, and called it a day! <p /><br />P.S. This reminds me of a Soviet joke my Dad used to tell, that I&#8217;ll translate here into English. It doesn&#8217;t carry over all too well, but some of you may be amused at the self-deprecation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><br />The Americans are trying to steal the Russian <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mig_29">MiG-29</a> plans.<br />The CIA sends a spy who manages to come back with the blueprints.<br />They build them only to discover they&#8217;ve just built a steam locomotive.<br />So they send a better spy who comes back with plans that he&#8217;s sure are the right ones.<br />They build them, and find they&#8217;ve got another locomotive.<br />This time they send their best spy, and his orders are to bring back the head engineer.<br />Back in the US with the engineer they ask him what they were doing wrong. The engineer looks at the plans they&#8217;ve stolen and at the locomotive, and points at some fine print on the plans, &#8220;See? you&#8217;ve just forgotten to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_(tool)">file</a> it down!&#8221;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><br /><strong>Edit:</strong> Fix in the comments has been applied, and the whole app is now on BitBucket, so download it from there: <a href="http://bitbucket.org/anateus/moviesneak.py">http://bitbucket.org/anateus/moviesneak.py</a></p>
<p>I&#8217;m happy to announce the release of version 0.5 of moviesneak.py, script for figuring out what movies come right after each other such that you can go from one to the next on a single ticket.</p>
<p>This version follows an age-old tradition of BASIC programs by prompting you for information step by step. The date, zipcode, movie theater, and movies you actually want to watch. Then it prints out a list of movie pairs (I doubt you&#8217;re going to sit through more than two).</p>
<p>Currently a tolerance of 15 minutes is hardcoded, fairly straightforward to modify. What this mean is that if one movie starts 15 minutes before another ends, it would still recommend them as a pair, what with previews and whatnot. If the opposite is true, 15 minutes is not too suspicious a time to loiter about :&gt;</p>
<p>The code is distributed under a BSD license. It requires BeautifulSoup which I&#8217;ve included in my distribution, so you just need Python!</p>
<p>Happy sneaking! Don&#8217;t get caught :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content">The following quote is from a talk by physicist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_feynman">Richard Feynman</a> called <a href="http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/49/2/Religion.htm">The Relation of Science and Religion</a>, which I consider a apologia of sorts:

<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">I don&#8217;t know the answer to this central problem â the problem of maintaining the real value of religion, as a source of strength and of courage to most men, while, at the same time, not requiring an absolute faith in the metaphysical  aspects.</blockquote>

I feel that&#8217;s the core of the conflict. Whatever aspects religion has, they are thoroughly dependent on an unquestioning acceptance of some metaphysical model, whether a minimalist one such as in Deism or one as expansive and involved as in Animism. This is the aspect that is antithetical to science, not just in science&#8217;s conclusions (it&#8217;s hard to falsify a deistic model, unlikely that will occur any time soon) but fundamentally in its approach.

  <div class="entry-content"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_transformation">Operational Transformation</a> (OT) is the theoretical secret juice behind <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_wave">Google Wave</a>. It is the technique that allows concurrent editing that resolves conflicts and prevents the need for edit locks and the like.

At its core Google Wave is an extension of the XMPP protocol to support OT, with the sought after invites being for Google&#8217;s official Wave server and its attendant web client. However, multiple clients and servers are not only possible, but desirable and planned. There&#8217;s already <a href="http://pygowave.net/">PyGoWave</a> for those interested. On top of this core there are several other things such as APIs for automated agents and the like.

Some people were immediately struck by Google Wave and a few of the demos. However, most people were a bit confused about what it was and in what ways it is superior to e-mail, instant messaging and wikis. It was touted by its creators as a replacement to all of these, and I&#8217;m not convinced that is the case.

The nature of Google Wave encourages the collaborative creation of prose in a dialectic style, once rather popular but I think a bit neglected these days. 

It allows the interactivity and most importantly tight coupling with other participants that media such as IRC and Instant Messaging allow but without the strong preference for terse expression. 

Google Wave, I hope, will lead to a resurrection of dialectical prose.

  <div class="entry-content">I&#8217;m currently residing in Mountain View, California.

I co-founded a startup called <a href="http://highlightcam.com">HighlightCam</a>, which has been funded by <a href="http://ycombinator.com">Y Combinator</a>, a seed-funding company that provides extensive counseling and instruction in addition to money.

We <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/28/yc-funded-highlightcam-makes-it-easy-to-remotely-watch-babies-pets-and-burglars/">launched</a> a couple of weeks ago.

Working on a startup is clearly what I was meant to do. Been enjoying it immensely. Will post more side-project type stuff when I have time to work on side-projects :)

  <div class="entry-content">My latest personal project is <a href="http://www.mbtasux.com">MBTAsux</a>.

For those who don&#8217;t know, the <a href="http://mbta.com">MBTA</a> is Boston&#8217;s public transportation authority, running subways, busses, commuter rail, and the like.

To say the least, many people are unhappy with the way it is operated. So, as a subject near and dear to my heart, I decide to make MBTAsux.

What it is: grabbing twitter messages and posting them in a format that allows easy skimming, in addition to extracting some data from the text.

The things I&#8217;m interested in:
<ul>
<li>Rudimentary sentiment analysis, i.e. how are people feeling about the MBTA right now?</li>
<li>Location tracking. I want to figure out where people complain the most. Control that for the &#8220;size&#8221; of the stations (Park and South Station would probably win the popular vote here).</li>
</ul>

Things I&#8217;ve yet to implement that I think are essential:
<ul>
<li>Submission form, and a mobile version of it. You know, for people who don&#8217;t use twitter.</li>
<li>Map. Alas, people are not really mentioning their exact stops when they complain. So there is a really small percentage of twitters coming in that would be mappable. This brings me to the next feature:</li>
<li>A nano-format for complaining about the MBTA on twitter and other media. Something like: <i>s:kendall someone just played the Marseillaise on the hanging pipes #mbtasux</i>
</li>

How I wrote it:
<ul>
<li>Python</li>
<li>Google App Engine</li>
<li>Latest version of the code will be released soon under a BSD license.</li>
</ul>

Enjoy!</ul>

This is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography">steganography</a> tool that can hide text within text that is unicode encoded, and has lots of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritic">diacritics</a>. I&#8217;m exploiting a feature of unicode that allows characters with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritic">diacritics</a> to be written either as a monolithic &#8220;composed&#8221; character that is a single symbol, or in a &#8220;decomposed&#8221; form in which the component symbols combine. These two different ways to represent the underlying characters are visually indistinguishable. This is where I&#8217;m hiding the secret plaintext.
