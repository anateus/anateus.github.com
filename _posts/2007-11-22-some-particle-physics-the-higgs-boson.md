The best explanation of what the Higgs Boson is, what it means to science, and generally talking about particle physics in a widely accessible way thot I have ever read:


The Higgs boson..the “God Particle” (ick…sorry Leon). The Holy Grail of particle physics. (Um, also there’s that dark matter stuff but who knows what it might be…) 

Where to begin? The Higgs boson is one thing, or many, there, or not, waiting to be discovered, if we can. But what is it? Why is it? Does it exist at all?
