Two sites that will help you make more of Amazon.com:
<ul>
	<li>
<a href="http://deallocker.com/tool/secret-amazon-discount/">DealLocker Amazon Discount Search</a> lets you search Amazon by the rate of discount.</li>
	<li>
<a href="http://www.filleritem.com/">FillerItem</a> lets you put in the amount you are short to get the Amazon Free Super Saver Shipping, so you can get a product as close to that as possible, to save yourself both the shipping charges and whatever you may overpay in your overzealous purchasing to attempt to fill the gap!</li>
</ul>
