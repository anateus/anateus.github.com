User interfaces matter. I was watching a recent episode of [The Taste](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Taste), and one of the contestants' meatloaf just wasn't cooking. Every time she went back to her oven she'd see the touch screen display 350F. She would slide the touch-based temperature slider to 550F and walk away. But when she'd return, the temperature was back to 350F.

The first time she did this I had a suspicion. The second time she went to back to the screen, I was able to confirm it. The temperature selection screen had an OK button on the bottom right. Just like it's a [modal dialog](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_dialog). She would set the temperature, but walk away without tapping that all-important OK button so the temperature wasn't actually being adjusted.

User interfaces use metaphors in order to access shortcuts you already have in your brain. This is why [skeumorphism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeumorphism#Digital_skeuomorphs) is used in the design of digital interfaces, so you don't have to learn a completely new way to perform a task.

One of the most simple interfaces is a lever. It [affords](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordance) manipulation and it augments human capability: you can exert greater force. But it's also a metaphor for what a user interface is. If an interfaces does not enable enhancement of capacity, it is actively a hinderance. To avoid [cargo cult design](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult#Metaphorical_uses_of_the_term) always consider what you attempting to enable and how much leverage you are contributing.
