I have finished my independent study course titled <em>Exploring the Exocortex</em>.

I enjoyed it immensely and learned a lot while doing it, only some of which I was able to condense into the paper below.

Some thanks:
<ul>
	<li>
<a href="http://www.dangrover.com/">Dan Grover</a> -- for mentioning MontyLingua to me and speeding up the development process many-fold</li>
	<li>Hugo Lin -- for <a href="http://web.media.mit.edu/~hugo/montylingua/">MontyLingua</a>
</li>
	<li>Steven Bird, Edward Loper, and Ewan Klein -- for <a href="http://www.nltk.org/">NLTK</a>
</li>
	<li>
<a href="http://www.cs.rochester.edu/~james/">James Allen</a> -- for providing the impetus to choose VerbNet over FrameNet thus saving me many headaches.</li>
	<li>
<a href="http://www.cs.brandeis.edu/~tim/">Timothy Hickey</a> -- for advising the course and allowing such non-standard research to take place</li>
</ul>

<em>The paper:</em>

<a href="http://logarchy.org/exocortex.pdf">"Exploring the Exocortex: An Approach to Optimizing Human Productivity" by Michael Katsevman</a><sup>PDF</sup>


I will publish the code soon as I finish cleaning it up and packaging.
