I'm just wondering why you can only make appointments at places by phone rather than email.

When you email them (if they have one posted) they might deign to reply with availability but request you call them.

Do they think that a phone is safer in regards to identity? or are they just afraid of this newfangled technology?

In an age where the corporate world can't survive without email--and some younger people think it's already outdated--how can it be anyone sitting at a customer service level can't use it for any purpose beyond answering a cursory question with a cursory answer?
