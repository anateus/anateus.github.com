<p><br />In Washington there isn't any plan<br />With "feeding David" on page sixty-four;<br />It must be accidental that the milk man<br />Leaves a bottle at my door.<p />It must be accidental that the butcher<br />Has carcasses arriving at his shop<br />The very place where, when I need some meat,<br />I accidentally stop.<p />My life is chaos turned miraculous;<br />I speak a word and people understand<br />Although it must be gibberish since words<br />Are not produced by governmental plan.<p />Now law and order, on the other hand<br />The state provides us for the public good;<br />That's why there's instant justice on demand<br />And safety in every neighborhood.</p>
