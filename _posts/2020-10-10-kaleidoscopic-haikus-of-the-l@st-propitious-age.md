In the 90s, my dad worked for a vector graphics startup. Sometimes he'd bring home these thick softcover books filled with glossy pages covered with nothing but pictures. Some of them were nothing but rows of tiny boxes barely big enough to appreciate page after page of idyllic azure beaches, or hands being shaken, or piles of currency, or majestic vistas, or laughing multi-ethnic faces. Others had bigger prints and included illustrations, or abstract patterns, or closeups of a leaf's surface.

As a kid who would read encyclopedias cover to cover this was just the sort of information firehose I loved, this time in visual form.{% sidenote * 'SOme note.' %} These bound galleries were stock photo catalogs.

A few months after my son was born, I was thinking of more things I'd like to show him some day and remembered these long forgotten catalogs. I also remembered their smell. They smelled a bit like a cross between a bookstore full of new books and a photograph freshly pulled from the paper envelope it arrived in from the photo lab {% sidenote * 'Only applicable to Elder Millenials and above.' %}. __More descriptions of the catalogs__


Stock photography as the most naked of coolhound outputs, both ahead and behind the times.
