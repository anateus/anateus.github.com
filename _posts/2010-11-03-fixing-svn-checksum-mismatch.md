All the info I found addressing this contains way too much cruft and doesn&#39;t present the actual solution clearly. Here are steps that will work, so you can get back to coding:<br /><ol><li>Copy the file away</li><li>svn revert FILENAME (in case you have local changes)<br /> </li><li>svn rm FILENAME</li><li>svn ci -m &quot;Fixing checksum mismatch&quot;</li><li>Copy the file back</li><li>svn add FILENAME</li><li>svn ci -m &quot;Fixed checksum mismatch&quot;</li></ol>There you go. No more headache.
