Just thought I might make it a point to mention I recently joined the engineering team at [Comprehend](http://www.comprehend.com/), a fellow Y Combinator company. We make analytics software targeting pharmaceutical companies in an industry that's filled with balkanized solutions. Helping tackle the byzantine challenges involved in clinical trials should be interesting!

As usual, I must add that my opinions and comments and do not represent my employer in any way shape or form.
