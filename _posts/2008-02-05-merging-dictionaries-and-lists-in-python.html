title: Merging Dictionaries and Lists in Python

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>
<p>Apparently this got posted to reddit a while ago, and several better versions were provided, here's what I would use now:</p>
<p>[code] def merge_lists(*ls): return sum(ls, [])
 def merge_dicts(*dicts): dict(merge_lists(*map(dict.items, dicts))) [/code]</p>
<hr />
<p>I came up with what I think is a rather pretty and elegant way to merge dictionaries (and lists) in Python:</p>
<p>[code]def merge_lists(*lists):
 return reduce(lambda x, y: x+y,lists)

def merge_dicts(*dictionaries):
 result = {}
 
 for key in set(merge_lists([d.keys() for d in dictionaries])):
 result[key] = merge_lists([d[key] for d in dictionaries if key in d])
 
 return result [/code]</p>
<p>Some explanation for novices:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>*arg</code> notation means that any unnamed arguments (that is, not like this: <code>funct(foo="bar")</code>) will be stores in a tuple named arg.</li>
<li>The <code>reduce(funct,collection)</code> will sequentially apply the function <code>funct()</code> to each member of <code>collection</code>. The classic example is that <code>reduce(lambda x, y: x+y, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])</code> calculates <code>((((1+2)+3)+4)+5)</code>.</li>
<li>List comperehensions are super fun and work like this: <code>[something(value) for value in list]</code> does <code>something</code> to each <code>value</code> in <code>list</code>, and returns the results in a list containing the results of <code>something(value)</code>. There is a permutation that looks like this: <code>[something(value) for value in list if value &gt; 5]</code> (any condition can be placed after the <code>if</code>), this only adds <code>something(value)</code> to the list if the condition is <code>true</code>.</li>
</ul>
