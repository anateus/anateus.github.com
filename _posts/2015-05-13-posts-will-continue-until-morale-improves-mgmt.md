Going to resume posting, collating smaller thoughts I've had and sometimes posted on other media. Perhaps it'll encourage me to expand on some.

- A cult becomes a religion when you can be one just on holidays.
- Being kind is better than being nice.
- If you've known me for any length of time you've probably heard me crack my knuckles. 
    - Here's what actually happens: [Real-Time Visualization of Joint Cavitation](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0119470)
    - But don't worry, it's safe: [Ig Nobel Winner Shows Knuckle Cracking Wonâ€™t Cause Arthritis](http://tech.mit.edu/V129/N41/ignobels.html)
- [ASCII](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/ASCII_art)/[ANSI art](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/ANSI_art) is old hat. New hotness? [PETSCII](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/PETSCII) art. The thing that really does it for me is it contains triangles.
    - Here's a [gallery/competition of PETSCII art](http://csdb.dk/event/?id=2139&sort=rating)
- [Pulmonic ingressives](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Ingressive_sound) in the wild: <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/URgdIAz4QNg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
