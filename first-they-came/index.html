First they came for the hackers.
    But I never did anything illegal with my computer,
        so I didn't speak up.
Then they came for the pornographers.
    But I thought there was too much smut on the Internet anyway,
        so I didn't speak up.
Then they came for the anonymous remailers.
    But a lot of nasty stuff gets sent from anon.penet.fi,
        so I didn't speak up.
Then they came for the encryption users.
    But I could never figure out how to work PGP anyway,
        so I didn't speak up.
Then they came for me.
    And by that time there was no one left to speak up.

In Germany they first came for the Communists, 
    and I didn't speak up because I wasn't a Communist. 
Then they came for the Jews, 
    and I didn't speak up because I wasn't a Jew. 
Then they came for the trade unionists, 
    and I didn't speak up because I wasn't a trade unionist. 
Then they came for the Catholics, 
    and I didn't speak up because I was a Protestant. 
Then they came for me - 
    and by that time no one was left to speak up.
