      <h1>E-Mail and Making Appointments</h1>
<p class="subtitle">November 25, 2007</p>

<p>I’m just wondering why you can only make appointments at places by phone rather than email.</p>

<p>When you email them (if they have one posted) they might deign to reply with availability but request you call them.</p>

<p>Do they think that a phone is safer in regards to identity? or are they just afraid of this newfangled technology?</p>

<p>In an age where the corporate world can’t survive without email–and some younger people think it’s already outdated–how can it be anyone sitting at a customer service level can’t use it for any purpose beyond answering a cursory question with a cursory answer?</p>
