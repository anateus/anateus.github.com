  <div class="entry-content" style="font-family: ; font-size: ">I have just finished v0.1 of Gargoyle (yes, it's a Snow Crash reference).

Gargoyle is a python application that periodically queries your location via GPS and then checks to see whether you are withn range of an item on your watch list. It is written to run on <a href="http://maemo.org/">Maemo</a> devices such as the Nokia N800 and N810 (and possibly the 770, too).

The watch list can contain such items as "any chinese restaurants with ratings of 3.5 stars on yelp and above" or "any locations mentioned within the last week in <a href="http://boingboing.net/">boingboing</a> posts" (<a href="http://www.geonames.org/">GeoNames</a> is invaluable here). They won't be defined in quite the flowing natural language seen here, but the possibilities are still mind bogglingly exciting.

If you are wearing a bluetooth headset, it then it uses <a href="http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/flite/">flite</a> to read to you some information about the item on your watchlist based on a particular prompt for that item. This will be something like "[Name] is [Distance] away, rated [rating] stars, and located at [Address]" for the restaurant, and "This location is mentioned in [Post_Title], [Post_Author] says [Location_In_Context_Sentence]" for the <a href="http://boingboing.net/">BoingBoing</a> tracker.

But all this stuff is to come. Here's what the current version, which mostly amounts to a proof of concept does: it tells you the name of the town you are in using geonames, and then it finds the single nearest pizza place within half a mile and tells you its name, address, and distance.

So you want to test it out? Here it is: <a href="http://www.mockingeye.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/gargoyle-01.py" title="Gargoyle v0.1">Gargoyle v0.1</a> (WARNING: ugly, hacky, raw code. Not for the faint of heart.)

But there are some things that you need to do before it runs:
<ul>	<li>You need the following packages besides python: python-gpsbt (it's on the Maemo Extras repository)</li>
	<li>You need flite installed (same repo).</li>
	<li>An Application ID from Yahoo that you need to insert in the right location in the code. You can get them <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/wsregapp/index.php">HERE</a>. Note that the Yahoo links point to the same address with <strong>https://</strong> instead of <strong>http://</strong>, it will even redirect you there after you login. you'll likely have to manually change the address back to <strong>http://</strong>.</li>
</ul>

I think that about covers it. Play around with it if you'd like! Comment with suggestion, criticisms, and whatnot. Don't start coding patches and such just yet, since this is a POC. I'm going to actually follow a design I had previously prepared in creating Gargoyle v0.2, and that's when I will welcome many patches, design discussions, and so forth.

  <div class="entry-content" style="font-family: ; font-size: ">Other good ones are nigger, kike, spic, wop, chink, gook, what have ya.

Still reading? Good. Words carry meaning, they carrry feelings and intentions. And sometimes they are meant in an aggressive manner, sometimes they're meant to hurt you. However, unlike a bullet, a fist, or a blade, they can't really stop you in your tracks. More importantly, they shouldn't. If you have the choice of letting a word make you miserable, and you choose to do so, instead of taking in the intent without permitting it to hurt you, you're putting that weapon in your enemy's hands. Why would you do that?

Many people insist on the taboo status of certain words. But they are giving someone the <strong>power</strong> to say a word and wound them without raising a fist. How can that be beneficial? Why is there a word that your kid can say that will make you smack them on the mouth or wash it out with soap?


I see people giving power to racists and bigots and just plain assholes, merely by agreeing to be offended. It is meant to hurt, but why succumb to your enemies when you can choose otherwise?

  <div class="entry-content" style="font-family: ; font-size: ">I'm just wondering why you can only make appointments at places by phone rather than email.

When you email them (if they have one posted) they might deign to reply with availability but request you call them.

Do they think that a phone is safer in regards to identity? or are they just afraid of this newfangled technology?

In an age where the corporate world can't survive without email--and some younger people think it's already outdated--how can it be anyone sitting at a customer service level can't use it for any purpose beyond answering a cursory question with a cursory answer?

  <div class="entry-content" style="font-family: ; font-size: ">In the early 20th century London was full of electric busses that soon went away, displaced by internal combustion machines. Why did they go away?

The Economist has a great article telling the story:

<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">...
...
Whether the fraud was truly a tipping point for electric vehicles is, of course, impossible to say. But it is a commonplace of innovation—from railway gauges to semiconductors to software—that the “best” technology is not always the most successful. Once an industry standard has been established, it is hard to displace. If Lehwess and Martigny had not pulled their scam when they did, modern cities might be an awful lot cleaner.</blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content" style="font-family: ; font-size: ">The best explanation of what the Higgs Boson is, what it means to science, and generally talking about particle physics in a widely accessible way thot I have ever read:


The Higgs boson..the “God Particle” (ick…sorry Leon). The Holy Grail of particle physics. (Um, also there’s that dark matter stuff but who knows what it might be…) 

Where to begin? The Higgs boson is one thing, or many, there, or not, waiting to be discovered, if we can. But what is it? Why is it? Does it exist at all?

  <div class="entry-content" style="font-family: ; font-size: ">Apparently, Yamaha has been developing <a href="http://www.global.yamaha.com/tenori-on/index.html">a new MIDI instrument called the Tenori-On</a>.

Now, it's finally commercially available. one sold on ebay just recently for $1202 or so. Guess what I want for $gift_giving_holiday?

Here's the music video for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simian_Mobile_Disco">Simian Mobile Disco</a>'s Hustler: <a href="http://creativity-online.com/work/view?seed=e29a3195">Sexy chicks are soon introduced to food, with interesting results</a>.

  <div class="entry-content" style="font-family: ; font-size: ">The most compelling fiction, science or otherwise, often depicts a breakdown of society. Here's a <a href="http://snarkerati.com/movie-news/the-top-50-dystopian-movies-of-all-time/">list of 50 dystopian movies</a> some of which are actually good! My personal favorites are <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0238380/">Equilibrium</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0405296/">A Scanner Darkly</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094625/">Akira</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118929/">Dark City</a>. Some other movies on the list are also quite good, but don't deserve a special mention.

Here's a video of some <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WpYWpN0VXU">Soviet soldiers dancing</a> what looks to me like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazachok">Kaзaчoк</a>.

My plan to become a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyborg">cyborg</a> is one step closer with a Japanese-developed system that reads <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EEG">EEG signals</a> and directs an avatar in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_life">Second Life</a>. Here's <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhCBZcq58c0">a video of this in action</a>. They  don't seem to have turning quite down, but this is quite good for a totally non-invasive system!

  <div class="entry-content" style="font-family: ; font-size: ">While I slowly write more abstract and long posts, I decided I can have smaller posts with links and reccomendations and such. This is the first, we'll see if the habit sticks.

A post on one of my favourite computer scince blogs about <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2007/09/fast_arithmetic_and_fractals.php">speeding up integer arithmetic using fractals</a> should show you they're good for stuff other than just pretty pictures (and he also has a <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2007/09/fractal_applications_logistica.php">previous post</a> on the subject).

Ever wanted to extract some DNA at a party? Or from just about anything using household items? Well, <a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2007/10/2/114918/141">now you can</a>. Who said Kuro5hin was dead?

Most of my food is eaten as packed lunches, what better way to increase meal satisfaction than applying the Japanese Bento ("boxed lunch") aesthetic. But what if buying lacquered cherry woodg boxes ain't your thing? don't despair, you can still have <a href="http://freakintastybento.wordpress.com/2007/08/19/bento-for-cheap-bastards/">pretty and mobile food on the cheap</a>. If that didn't quite pique your interest head over to the <a href="http://lunchinabox.net/">ultimate bento blog</a> for incredible pictures and recipes.

Like one of my favourite blogs, <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/">Marginal Revolution</a>, I intend to talk about things that I think are under-appreciated, and not just add momentum to the meme juggernauts. Hope you'll enjoy it.

  <div class="entry-content" style="font-family: ; font-size: ">This is an old writeup of a proposed way to settle some of the obstacles to peace in Israel. It's still has relevant as it was then, and the predictions of failure in Iraq (past the removal of Saddam) by its authors were completly vindicated.

I've interspersed the writeup with my comments.

<blockquote>Some people think that peace between Israel and Palestine is impossible. One way to solve an impossible problem is to first remove a major constraint to its solution. If the now-simplified problem can be solved, the constraint can be re-added subsequently. For instance, if we remove the financial constraint which always puts peacemaking at a lower priority than military action we could ask: How might the Mideast conflict be solved given funding on the scale of the pending war with Iraq?

The wars on Afghanistan and now Iraq are seen as an investment, with a "Return on Investment" (ROI) of establishing new, quisling governments willing to discount the price of oil and natural gas. Could a business case be made that the ROI of a massive investment in peace will be much greater than the ROI of a war? The cost of the pending war is very high, estimated recently at $200B by a presidential advisor in the WSJ, not including the human capital. Rather than spending these vast sums on munitions and destruction, could large scale spending on peace not only avoid the devastation, but actually create wealth through economic growth tied to consumer and investor confidence? Significant peace dividends could come in the form of a reduced dependence on foreign aid as well as enhanced human capital.</blockquote>

No longer pending, the Iraq war has already cost over $400,000,000,000 (zeroes for effect, that's $400 billion).
