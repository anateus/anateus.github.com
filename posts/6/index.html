  <div class="entry-content" style="font-family: ; font-size: ">Version 0.2 of the Gargoyle <acronym title="Point of Interest">POI</acronym> Server (GPS) is now ready.

The latest source code tarball is here: <a href="http://www.mockingeye.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/gargoyle_poi_server-02.tar.gz" title="Gargoyle POI Server v0.2">Gargoyle POI Server v0.2</a>. (Warning, almost no documentation and only basic comments)
Requirements: <a href="http://python.org/">python</a>, <a href="http://webpy.org/">web.py</a>, <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/couchdb/">CouchDB</a>, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/couchdb-python/">couchdb-python</a>

But, what is it?

A POI is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_of_interest">Point of Interest</a>. That is, it is an atomic element of geospatial information. The Gargoyle POI Server is the backend server to the Gargoyle Personal Agent (previously introduced under the name Gargoyle alone).

GPS is written in Python using <a href="http://webpy.org/">web.py</a> as the frontend, and <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/couchdb/">CouchDB</a> for data storage.  Web.py was chosen because it is small, fast, and output format agnostic. CouchDB provides schema-flexible storage and potential scalability. It will also support robust access from many Gargoyle Personal Agents (GPAs) as well multiple Gargoyle Extraction Agent Service (GEAS) instances.

At the moment, the system can output the POIs either in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyhole_Markup_Language">KML</a> or in rudimentary HTML. The interface chosen is a simple <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST">RESTful</a> interface. At the moment, only <code>GET</code> is supported. <code>POST</code> will be implemented soon.

Here is the syntax for using the server once running (to start a server at port 8080 just run <code>python locator.py</code>:

To view the POIs for <code>userid</code> in the square created by <code>45.000000,47.000000</code> and <code>45.000999,47.000999</code> (format is <code>latitude, longitude</code>)
<blockquote class="posterous_short_quote"><code>http://server:8080/l/userid/45.000/47.000</code></blockquote>
If you want it in KML use this:
<blockquote class="posterous_short_quote"><code>http://server:8080/l/userid/45.000/47.000?kml</code></blockquote>
To add a POI to <code>userid</code> with an expiration date on May 1st:
<blockquote class="posterous_short_quote"><code>http://server:8080/a/userid/45.000123/47.000456<em>/1.3</em>/POIname<em>/POI Description/2008-05-01</em></code></blockquote>
The third number is the Altitude. Optional elements are in italics, and include the altitude, the description, and the expiration date (default is 3 days). The <code>userid</code> can really be anything. Ideally, it's just a long-ish hash that can't be easily gussed. This simplifies access, and offers a measure of privacy. For now, if you want your POIs secret, you can encrypt their contents in whatever way you wish. Access control is planned, and will be implemented in a future version.

Coming <strong>really</strong> soon: GeoRSS output for easy Google Maps mashups.

For planned development, look at the upcoming Roadmap post.

  <div class="entry-content" style="font-family: ; font-size: ">Official Gargoyle Roadmap, calluh callay!

Currently, Gargoyle consists of 3 parts:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.mockingeye.com/index.php/2008/04/22/introducing-gargoyle-poi-server/">Gargoyle POI Server (GPS)</a></li>
	<li>Gargoyle Extraction Agent Service (GEAS)</li>
	<li>Gargoyle Personal Agent (GPA)</li>
</ul>
At the moment, only GPS is truly usable, and even that is to a very limited degree. A proof of concept for GPA was posted, and most of a v0.2 was written, but that codebase will be abandoned. GEAS is for now just a whole bunch of ideas without a single line of code.

What follows is a breakdown of what each component of Gargoyle is, what features are implemented, and what features are planned.

  <div class="entry-content" style="font-family: ; font-size: ">Remember <a href="http://www.mockingeye.com/index.php/2007/12/12/introducing-gargoyle-the-geospatial-web-in-your-pocket/">Gargoyle</a>?

Well, it hasn't been abandoned yet. I've been rewriting the design and scrapping it over and over. I think I've finally reached a design that's stable, and that will plug nicely into all kinds of stuff.

Today I wrote a lightweight <a href="http://new.webpy.org/">web.py</a>-based <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_of_Interest">POI</a> system. It gives a user a random hash which is used to identify a unique POI list. Access is done <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer">RESTfully</a>. That is:

<blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">
<code>http://www.example.com/locate/te6hemi8t3cu/38.89768/-77.036455/</code>
</blockquote>

Which would display all POIs in the list <code>te6hemi8t3cu</code> that are in the box bounded by <code>(38.897000, -77.036000)</code> and <code>(38.897999, -77.036999)</code>. That is, three spaces after the decimal is my chosen granularity (it's roughly walking distance). The POI list is produced either in a human readable bullet-point list (for easy display on mobile devices), or as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyhole_Markup_Language">KML</a> file (with some added metadata of course. Such as an expiration date for the entry).

Adding a POI is just as easy, just using <code>add</code> instead of <code>locate</code>, and appending <code>/poi_info</code> to the URL.

This means that you can easily write apps to use this simple API, as well as display it using Google Earth.

What's the next step? I need to convert my already existing client for the Nokia N800 to be able to use this POI list, as well as maintain its own POI cache. It should only read to the user things within a 4 or 5 decimal space distance, and not bother querying unless the user is approaching the edges of the grid box she's in.

Finally, once these infrastructure issues are taken care of, the real purpose of Gargoyle will be implemented. This takes the form of a the app that goes through your "reading list" and adds relevant items to the POI list. 

I will post the code for the N800 code and the POI server some time within the week. It still needs some cleanup. Gargoyle v0.2 here we come!

<strong>Addendum:</strong> POIs can also be meta-POIs. That is, rather than being a placename, an entry into the db can be a uri to an external kml source (can be dynamic). An example would be a URL that points to a script that forwards the coords to the <a href="http://www.geonames.org/export/wikipedia-webservice.html">Geonames Wikipedia web service service</a> (shows nearest wikipedia entries) and converts the resulting XMl or JSON into KML.

  <div class="entry-content" style="font-family: ; font-size: ">There are many myths about terrorists and their origins, motivators, goals and methods. There are many pundits who express their various opinions and conjectures. But there are relatively few works that present more studied information.

Here are two books that I own, which provide a wealth of information. Each of these tomes completes the other:
<ul>
	<li>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0691134383?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=themoceye-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0691134383">What Makes a Terrorist: Economics and the Roots of Terrorism</a> by Alan Krueger<img src="/images/media_httpwwwassocama_kgolb.jpg" alt="Making a Terrorist" />
</li>
	<li>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/037541486X?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=themoceye-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=037541486X">The Looming Tower: Al-Qaeda and the Road to 9/11</a> by Lawrence Wright<img src="/images/media_httpwwwassocama_tCFGf.jpg" alt="Making a Terrorist" />
</li>
</ul>

The first of these, with a rather odacious title, is based on a lecture series given by its author, a respected economist. It is a fairly slim paperback overflowing with data. There are tables filled with meaningful figures nearly every other page. This work is an attempt to understand the circumstances and demographics of terrorism. As <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2007/08/what-makes-a-te.html">one review of the book</a> stated, it really does not answer the question posed by its title. Rather, it describes what terrorism isn't. Poor economic prospects, poor eduction, poor healthcare, all those are factors commonly presented as motivators for terrorism. Krueger's meticulous analysis shows that this is rarely the case.

His investigation shows that no single religion has the lion's share of terrorists. Nevertheless, most terrorism is perpetrated by members of a religious group other than that targeted. Other factors that Krueger finds <em>do</em> characterize terrorists are limited political freedoms and civil liberties. 

Wright's Pulitzer-prize winning masterpiece follows quite a different side of terrorism. Rather than concentrating on data, it provides a non-fiction narrative following radical Islamism from its roots with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayyid_Qutb">Sayyid Qutb</a> to the important-to-America <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osama_Bin_Laden">Osama Bin Laden</a>. Captivating in its detail, Wright creates an intimate profile of the men who shape much of terrorist-spawning radical Islam.

The two books together construct a visceral image of one of the greatest dangers facing our world. They are illuminating, educational, and very very important.

  <div class="entry-content" style="font-family: ; font-size: ">My online identity is highly fragmented. Some parts are public, others are restricted to specific groups. Part of my identity is <em>presence</em>. That is, the way people can find out what I'm doing, and contact me. Here is a taxonomy of some different aspects of my Online Identity:
<ul>
	<li>
<strong>Events:</strong> Google Calendar, Facebook Events</li>
	<li>
<strong>Personal Information:</strong> Facebook, LinkedIn</li>
	<li>
<strong>Text Messaging:</strong> AIM, SMS, GoogleTalk, Email</li>
	<li>
<strong>Voice:</strong> Cell, Skype</li>
	<li>
<strong>Contacts:</strong> Facebook, LinkedIn, Gmail contacts, Cellphone contacts</li>
	<li>
<strong>Presence:</strong> AIM Away message, Facebook status, Twitter</li>

</ul>

The idea of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_messaging">Unified Messaging</a> is a vertical solution in that it attempts to aggregate the methods of contact for one person, but it usually does so via proprietary solutions for each category. That is, there is a provided method for events (that is, calendar), personal information, text messaging, and voice.

What I want is a way to take all of my existing solutions, and create an intermediate format, which can be used to update all the rest. And then I want mobile access.

I plan on integrating some of this into Gargoyle. The method of implementation will most likely be FOAF, though I'm as yet unsure about how I want to store my events. Events right now are probably the best category, since facebook publishes an iCal feed of my events, which I have imported as a dynamic calendar into my Google Calendar. The Google Calendar, in turn, sends me event notifications to my cell, via SMS.

My initial task is to be available via whatever way is most convenient, no matter what the original mode of contact was, with SMS being the common-denominator. This can be most easily achieved by putting gatekeeper bots at each incoming mode of communication. So, there will be an AIM bot, that when set to "on" would forward all incoming AIM messages to an appropriate alternative location. Perhaps an even easier way would be to use existing methods: run my own Jabber server, with transports for all the various protocols. Jabber is also the easiest method for which to write bots in python.

These are some preliminary ideas that I'm filing publically. More to come soon.

  <div class="entry-content" style="font-family: ; font-size: ">Recently <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Schneier">Bruce Schneier</a> posted <a href="http://www.wired.com/politics/security/commentary/securitymatters/2008/03/securitymatters_0306">a debunking of the idea of a Transparent Society</a> (such as put forward by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Brin">David Brin</a>). He argues that the while the more open exchange of information in society can lead to a power balance, existing power structures mean that those already powerful will benefit most from disclosure. Here's a quote near the top:

<blockquote>You cannot evaluate the value of privacy and disclosure unless you account for the relative power levels of the discloser and the disclosee.

If I disclose information to you, your power with respect to me increases. One way to address this power imbalance is for you to similarly disclose information to me. We both have less privacy, but the balance of power is maintained. But this mechanism fails utterly if you and I have different power levels to begin with.

An example will make this clearer. You're stopped by a police officer, who demands to see identification. Divulging your identity will give the officer enormous power over you: He or she can search police databases using the information on your ID; he or she can create a police record attached to your name; he or she can put you on this or that secret terrorist watch list. Asking to see the officer's ID in return gives you no comparable power over him or her. The power imbalance is too great, and mutual disclosure does not make it OK. </blockquote>

As a frequent advocate of transparency as a way to normalize power in a society I must clarify my position in light of these valid objections. Schneier very correctly points to "The Transparent Society" as an utopian ideal. Perhaps it is a tired trope, but I'd like to point out that "utopia" originally meant "no place". That is, a place of total transparency and thus balanced power is an unachievable goal on its face.

I advocate movement toward such a society in a way that---unlike Schneier assumptions about such ideas---maintains as much power as possible within the hands of those currently on the lower end of the scale. This is where cryptography and other protectors of your information/privacy come in. I disagree with Schneier's claim that there is an inherent value in privacy; it is only there to equalize the balance.

Thus, believing in transparency doesn't mean you accept a "me first" approach. One does not necessarily expose oneself first in the hope of the powerful following suit. Rather, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power-knowledge">power-knowledge</a> of the elite must be systematically broken down while protecting our own zealously all the while. Eventually, we should reach a sort of detente in the matter.

There are common-good externalities to transparency that are substantial, but as Schneier warns, we must equalize initial powers as much as possible before going "clear". Otherwise, the individual benefits are small, and the opportunity for exploitation increases.

<em>Caveat Patefactor!</em>

  <div class="entry-content" style="font-family: ; font-size: ">Democracy is founded on giving people the right to self-determination and the illusion that this is a good method by which to extract collective intelligence.

There is not the problem of the mob but quite the opposite: it is the massed individual stupidity which brings down the democratic endeavor.

Let us look at an example: There is a large jar filled with jelly beans---such as may be found at fairs and such---and people attempt to guess the correct number as closely as possible. What has been found is that people are usually wildly off the mark, and more often than not they follow a bias in one direction. However, the <em>average of guesses is amazingly close to the real number</em>.

Imagine following a standard democratic prescription, however, and merely picking the number most guessers chose (the <em>mode</em>) or even the middle value (the <em>median</em>): you would not get a good result at all! (<strong>Update:</strong> Robin Hanson (see below) says the median often gives results even better than the average, so... that would also work! :&gt;)

<em>Why should we then use a method this wretched to solve a problem not far off, namely that of electing our leaders?</em>
