      <h1>User Interfaces</h1>
<p class="subtitle">January 12, 2014</p>

<p>User interfaces matter. I was watching a recent episode of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Taste">The Taste</a>, and one of the contestants’ meatloaf just wasn’t cooking. Every time she went back to her oven she’d see the touch screen display 350F. She would slide the touch-based temperature slider to 550F and walk away. But when she’d return, the temperature was back to 350F.</p>

<p>The first time she did this I had a suspicion. The second time she went to back to the screen, I was able to confirm it. The temperature selection screen had an OK button on the bottom right. Just like it’s a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_dialog">modal dialog</a>. She would set the temperature, but walk away without tapping that all-important OK button so the temperature wasn’t actually being adjusted.</p>

<p>User interfaces use metaphors in order to access shortcuts you already have in your brain. This is why <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeumorphism#Digital_skeuomorphs">skeumorphism</a> is used in the design of digital interfaces, so you don’t have to learn a completely new way to perform a task.</p>

<p>One of the most simple interfaces is a lever. It <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordance">affords</a> manipulation and it augments human capability: you can exert greater force. But it’s also a metaphor for what a user interface is. If an interfaces does not enable enhancement of capacity, it is actively a hinderance. To avoid <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult#Metaphorical_uses_of_the_term">cargo cult design</a> always consider what you attempting to enable and how much leverage you are contributing.</p>
