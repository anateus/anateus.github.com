  <div class="entry-content" style="font-family: ; font-size: ">Democracy is founded on giving people the right to self-determination and the illusion that this is a good method by which to extract collective intelligence.

There is not the problem of the mob but quite the opposite: it is the massed individual stupidity which brings down the democratic endeavor.

Let us look at an example: There is a large jar filled with jelly beans---such as may be found at fairs and such---and people attempt to guess the correct number as closely as possible. What has been found is that people are usually wildly off the mark, and more often than not they follow a bias in one direction. However, the <em>average of guesses is amazingly close to the real number</em>.

Imagine following a standard democratic prescription, however, and merely picking the number most guessers chose (the <em>mode</em>) or even the middle value (the <em>median</em>): you would not get a good result at all! (<strong>Update:</strong> Robin Hanson (see below) says the median often gives results even better than the average, so... that would also work! :&gt;)

<em>Why should we then use a method this wretched to solve a problem not far off, namely that of electing our leaders?</em>

Two groups of culturally homogeneous boys were slowly introduced to one another, and conflict blazed out of nowhere. Just the mere grouping caused the boys to detect minute differences and exaggerate them until two distinct cultures emerged, at odds and in constant competition.

Only a tough common problem united them in a single struggle. Only after several more of these combined efforts did they decrease hostilities.

  <div class="entry-content" style="font-family: ; font-size: ">I've often looked to the roads, traffic, and vehicle-pedestrian interaction as a guide to human to behavior. It is a situation where the risk is very high and communication is highly constrained, so behavior strategies are more readily apparent.

Most of us know the roads as strongly structured environments with mostly clear rules regulating behavior, with fairly stiff penalties placed on violators. The theory being that the restricted communication and great complexity of navigating the roads and streets should be offset by the strict direction of behavior and heavy punishment to deter deviation.

In practice, those who cheat will win. Most people are risk-averse enough to allow the few bold and brash to take advantage of that for consistent gain. Alas, this leads to situations where this opportunistic behavior leads to disaster.

But this isn't the only problem. In recent years, more and more studies have come out showing that at least some of the problems on the roads stem from overconfidence which stems from the various risk-reducing tools we use. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seat_belt_legislation">Seat belts</a> tend to promote risky driving, although they certainly reduce fatilities by a huge percentage. A <a href="http://www.bath.ac.uk/news/articles/releases/overtaking110906.html">recent experiment by a professor at the University of Bath</a> had him biking and measuring the behavior of cars that drove past. When not wearing a helmet he was given a much wider berth than when doing so. Even more space was granted when he donned a woman's wig. This seems to indicate that the safety granted by the helmet encouraged drivers to take more risks in regards to the cyclist. Once again, bicycle helmets have an immensly beneficial effect in reducing fatalities to mere injuries, so this study should most certainly not be construed as a reason not to don one.

Taking this type of data into account, what can be done to improve the safety of everyone involved?

An idea of growing popularity is that of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_space">Shared Space</a>, pioneered by the Dutch traffic engineer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Monderman">Hans Monderman</a>. This is a model where nearly all traffic markings are removed from an area. This includes signs, traffic lights, and even the clear distinction between road and sidewalk. Intersection are converted into roundabouts.

The results from the several implementations of this model are overwhelmingly positive. This removal of strict direction forces all those involved, pedestrians and drivers alike, to pay much more attention to their environment. It demands the interaction via eye-contact and implicit behavior adjustment of all participants. The result is the smooth operation of traffic, where average speeds drops, but total trip times shorten, as well as huge improvement in safety --- fatality and injury rates plummet. After the initial period of habituation, no extreme vigilance from pedestrians or motorists is required as the more cautious behavior is internalized.

I contend that what can work in the street can also work in other areas of life where many demand regulation and strict control for the safety of all. No external authority or risk-reducing device can substitue for personal vigilance, skepticism, and common sense. And in many cases, as the above examples illustrate, relying on our own individual virtues can be much superior.

  <div class="entry-content" style="font-family: ; font-size: ">Yesterday, I was pulling out of a parking lot in my 2000 Honda Accord. In front of me was a Honda Civic that looked to be from the late 80's to early 90's.

And then, something amazing happened. <strong>Our blinkers synchronized!</strong>

For the half a minute or so we were both waiting for a right turn, our blinkers blinked in unison. Never deviating from the pattern, or moving apart as per usual. I always look at the blinkers at the vain hope that one day, just this will occur.

I was so gobsmacked I forgot to memorize the car's plate numbers! It was going the same way as I for a bit, so I followed just behind, and contemplated following the car to its destination but decided against it. After all, what the hell am I going to do? Go up to the driver and introduce myself?

Instead, I will just be content in the knowledge that for me, there is a car out there that blinks just like mine.

  <div class="entry-content" style="font-family: ; font-size: "><p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>
<p>Apparently this got posted to reddit a while ago, and several better versions were provided, here's what I would use now:</p>
<p>[code] def merge_lists(*ls): return sum(ls, [])
 def merge_dicts(*dicts): dict(merge_lists(*map(dict.items, dicts))) [/code]</p>
<hr />
<p>I came up with what I think is a rather pretty and elegant way to merge dictionaries (and lists) in Python:</p>
<p>[code]def merge_lists(*lists):
 return reduce(lambda x, y: x+y,lists)

def merge_dicts(*dictionaries):
 result = {}
 
 for key in set(merge_lists([d.keys() for d in dictionaries])):
 result[key] = merge_lists([d[key] for d in dictionaries if key in d])
 
 return result [/code]</p>
<p>Some explanation for novices:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>*arg</code> notation means that any unnamed arguments (that is, not like this: <code>funct(foo="bar")</code>) will be stores in a tuple named arg.</li>
<li>The <code>reduce(funct,collection)</code> will sequentially apply the function <code>funct()</code> to each member of <code>collection</code>. The classic example is that <code>reduce(lambda x, y: x+y, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])</code> calculates <code>((((1+2)+3)+4)+5)</code>.</li>
<li>List comperehensions are super fun and work like this: <code>[something(value) for value in list]</code> does <code>something</code> to each <code>value</code> in <code>list</code>, and returns the results in a list containing the results of <code>something(value)</code>. There is a permutation that looks like this: <code>[something(value) for value in list if value &gt; 5]</code> (any condition can be placed after the <code>if</code>), this only adds <code>something(value)</code> to the list if the condition is <code>true</code>.</li>

  <div class="entry-content" style="font-family: ; font-size: ">A cynical view I somewhat share, provided by the genius of Douglas Adam:

    ‘On [that] world, the people are people. The leaders are lizards. The people hate the lizards and the lizards rule the people.’
    ‘Odd,’ said Arthur, ‘I thought you said it was a democracy?’
    ‘I did,’ said Ford, ‘It is.’
    ‘So,’ said Arthur, hoping he wasn’t sounding ridiculously obtuse, ‘why don’t the people get rid of the lizards?’
    ‘It honestly doesn’t occur to them,’ said Ford. ‘They’ve all got the vote, so they all pretty much assume that the government they’ve voted in more or less approximates to the government they want.’
    ‘You mean they actually vote for the lizards?’
    ‘Oh yes,’ said Ford with a shrug, ‘of course.’
    ‘But,’ said Arthur, going for the big one again, ‘why?’
    ‘Because if they didn’t vote for a lizard,’ said Ford, ‘the wrong lizard might get in.’

  <div class="entry-content" style="font-family: ; font-size: ">Inspired by this concept of a "<a href="http://www.red-dot.sg/Concept/porfolio/06/05FN/R021LM.htm">Love Bed</a>" (pictured here)
[[posterous-content:hprvBwDbAjzbilgvEEls]]

I thought of ways to make a similar bed without all the complications inherent with a slotted system. That is, the surface of the bed would need to have that sort of give, while firmly supporting all others. The Tempurpedic beds are made of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_foam">memory foam</a> which is visco-elastic polyurethane. Unfortunately, they are uniformly hard across the whole surface. It would be possible to create a mattress made out memory foam strips of varying visco-elasticity, but this wouldn't work with different body types, or sleeping configurations (I often like to sleep diagonally when I'm alone).

So, I remembered about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetorheological_fluid">magnetoreological fluids</a>. These are fluids (and potentially other materials) whose visco-elasticity changes in the presence of a magnetic field. Specifically, we are interested in those which become harder in the presence of a stronger magnetic fields. This occurs because there are magnetic particles suspended within a medium, that are arranged into increasingly rigid structures in the presence of an increasingly strong magnetic field.

These have inherent disadvantages though, such as the weight of the suspended particles (iron is common) and the settling of the particles over time. These would make them seem inappropriate as a material for a mattress. Instead, I'm thinking of a foam mattress, perhaps the very same memory foam mentioned above, which is permeated by magnetic particles, varying the hardness of the foam in much the way it works in magnetorheological fluids.

Potential obstacles would be the need to maintain rather strong and large magnetic fields. These can be solved by replacing a full permeation of the foam with a mesh of tubes filled with a magnetorheological fluid.

Whatever way, I think some sort of bedding that does not actually affect body position, and compensates as much as possible for the unfortunate effects of gravity is both necessary and forthcoming.
