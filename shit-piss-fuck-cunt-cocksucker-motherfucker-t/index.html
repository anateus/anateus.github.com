      <h1>Shit, Piss, Fuck, Cunt, Cocksucker, Motherfucker, Tits</h1>
<p class="subtitle">November 25, 2007</p>

<p>Other good ones are nigger, kike, spic, wop, chink, gook, what have ya.</p>

<p>Still reading? Good. Words carry meaning, they carrry feelings and intentions. And sometimes they are meant in an aggressive manner, sometimes they’re meant to hurt you. However, unlike a bullet, a fist, or a blade, they can’t really stop you in your tracks. More importantly, they shouldn’t. If you have the choice of letting a word make you miserable, and you choose to do so, instead of taking in the intent without permitting it to hurt you, you’re putting that weapon in your enemy’s hands. Why would you do that?</p>

<p>Many people insist on the taboo status of certain words. But they are giving someone the <strong>power</strong> to say a word and wound them without raising a fist. How can that be beneficial? Why is there a word that your kid can say that will make you smack them on the mouth or wash it out with soap?</p>

<p>I see people giving power to racists and bigots and just plain assholes, merely by agreeing to be offended. It is meant to hurt, but why succumb to your enemies when you can choose otherwise?</p>
