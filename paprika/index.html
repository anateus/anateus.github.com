      <h1>Paprika!</h1>
<p class="subtitle">June 16, 2007</p>

<p>Paprika is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Kon">Satoshi Kon</a>’s latest animated movie. And while all of his work has been amazing, this one is in a separate class, a true masterpiece. The scene design, character art, animation, all superb. It was an absolute pleasure to watch. Every line, dot, and splotch of color was used to maximal effectiveness. Then, on top of that, an amazing soundtrack that immerses you into the world of Paprika.</p>

<p>Paprika deals with something that Kon tends to touch upon frequently: the interaction and conflict between dreams and reality. Tired of interspersing this theme into his work, Kon takes it to its pinnacle, breaking down the separation and letting the view revel in the hot fusion.</p>

<p>This movie was an absolute joy to watch, and that’s something that happens to me very rarely. Go and watch it! I think it’s on DVD, but I’m not sure. Either way, do yourself and everyone else a HUGE favor and watch the <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/sony/paprika/">Paprika trailer</a>!</p>
