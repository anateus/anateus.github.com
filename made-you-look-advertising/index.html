<meta name="description" content="I got a spam letter today from AT&amp;T. Except it didn’t say anything about who it was from on the outside. The addressee was “California Resident” so it was clear it was spam, but it was printed in a fake handwritten font, in a fake blue pen color. &lt;p /&gt; Upon opening the envelope you find a paper in standard Letter dimensions, with what looks like a photocopy of an ad, complete with the characteristic ink fading and smudging. Several parts of the ads had the same kind of fake blue pen marked up as if with notes by the kind sender. Although throughout the short interaction between myself and the letter I was quite aware it was just advertising, the anti-branding just drew me in. As far as I can recall, the AT&amp;T logo was only visible in one place, and even there it was understated and quite small. Maybe it was just my fascination with the thinking behind such an ad, but I felt drawn in against my will, my disbelief suspended just a tad. &lt;p /&gt; We live in a word saturated with brands. Also today, I saw a pack of Duracell batteries at Safeway that included a horrible plastic screwdriver shaped like a Duracell battery, clearly with the primary purpose of adding the brand to your life even though it’s obvious almost no one would actually use the dinky screwdriver; it would lay discarded somewhere, ready to anchor the brand when you least expect it. &lt;p /&gt; So, we seem to have developed powerful advertising ignoring skills. Some studies have shown that advertising we pay less attention to tends to have even greater effects, but I find this spam masquerading as a personal letter to be proof that we’ve gotten too good at discarding the useless brochures and pointless offers clogging our mailboxes. &lt;p /&gt; Perhaps once we get good at discarding these, they’ll be able to return to the gaudy spam of old." />
