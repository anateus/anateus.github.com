I'm currently residing in Mountain View, California.

I co-founded a startup called <a href="http://highlightcam.com">HighlightCam</a>, which has been funded by <a href="http://ycombinator.com">Y Combinator</a>, a seed-funding company that provides extensive counseling and instruction in addition to money.

We <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/28/yc-funded-highlightcam-makes-it-easy-to-remotely-watch-babies-pets-and-burglars/">launched</a> a couple of weeks ago.

Working on a startup is clearly what I was meant to do. Been enjoying it immensely. Will post more side-project type stuff when I have time to work on side-projects :)
