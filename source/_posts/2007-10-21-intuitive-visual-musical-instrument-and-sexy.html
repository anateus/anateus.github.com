Apparently, Yamaha has been developing <a href="http://www.global.yamaha.com/tenori-on/index.html">a new MIDI instrument called the Tenori-On</a>.

Here's an overall demo video that shows many of <a href="http://www.global.yamaha.com/tenori-on/features/index.html">the awesome functions of this device</a>:

Now, it's finally commercially available. one sold on ebay just recently for $1202 or so. Guess what I want for $gift_giving_holiday?

Here's the music video for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simian_Mobile_Disco">Simian Mobile Disco</a>'s Hustler: <a href="http://creativity-online.com/work/view?seed=e29a3195">Sexy chicks are soon introduced to food, with interesting results</a>. Warning: nearly NSFW. Visually and audially delightful.
