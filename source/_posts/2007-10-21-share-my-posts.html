Just added this pretty little Share This link to the blog. See it on the right?

Click on it! You'll see a large list pop up with all kinds of social bookmarking and news sites, as well as the ability to share by email, right there.

So, digg me, del.icio.us me, tailrank me, stumbleupon me what have ya.

Happy Sharing :&gt;

p.s. if you use some site that's not on the list, leave a comment, and I'll add it!
