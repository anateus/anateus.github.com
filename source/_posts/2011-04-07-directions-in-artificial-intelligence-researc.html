<p>Much of the early optimism about Artificial Intelligence was crushed by what is now called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moravec%27s_paradox" target="_blank">Moravec's Paradox</a>: it turns out that it's often substantially harder to replicate the lower-level sensorimotor skills of humans and animals than higher reasoning tasks. Students of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embodied_cognition" target="_blank">embodied cognition </a>see intelligence arising from a <em>necessary </em>interplay with our senses taking this even further, <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consciousness-higher/" target="_blank">higher-order theories of consciousness</a>--which I've recently become a fan of--have consciousness as a higher order layering on top of mere intelligence. Thus, we're adding a few more layers to the layer cake of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervenience" target="_blank">supervenience</a> (similar to what scientists often call "emergence", not used in Philosophy that way because the term has been claimed by a distinct usage).</p>
<p>I would love to see more work on complete end-to-end AI systems that have increasingly deeper levels of feedback. That's the only we'll see better AI. That and neural modelling which is getting reeeal interesting. I think I'll start posting links to some fun papers soon.</p>
