The most compelling fiction, science or otherwise, often depicts a breakdown of society. Here's a <a href="http://snarkerati.com/movie-news/the-top-50-dystopian-movies-of-all-time/">list of 50 dystopian movies</a> some of which are actually good! My personal favorites are <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0238380/">Equilibrium</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0405296/">A Scanner Darkly</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094625/">Akira</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118929/">Dark City</a>. Some other movies on the list are also quite good, but don't deserve a special mention.

Here's a video of some <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WpYWpN0VXU">Soviet soldiers dancing</a> what looks to me like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazachok">Kaзaчoк</a>.

My plan to become a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyborg">cyborg</a> is one step closer with a Japanese-developed system that reads <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EEG">EEG signals</a> and directs an avatar in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_life">Second Life</a>. Here's <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhCBZcq58c0">a video of this in action</a>. They  don't seem to have turning quite down, but this is quite good for a totally non-invasive system!
