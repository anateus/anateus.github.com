A moment of fancy on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRC">IRC</a> led me to concoct the following:

<blockquote class="posterous_short_quote"><code>((len([i for i in __globals__ if i is not god and type(i) is type(god)]) == 0) and (god.prophet == muhammad))) == True</code></blockquote>

This is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahadah">Shahadah</a> represented in Python.

Programming Language Wars are frequently religious, I thought why not take it a step further.
