What I find upsetting beyond the tragedies each side is inflicting on the another, is that the view I'm offered via social media and personal conversations doesn't lead me to believe a resolution is possible. Even people who are not currently under threat of death, where a short-sighted and narrow view would be understandable, stick with their preconceived ideas of the history and the motivations of the people involved.

In my experience the strength of one's opinion on the conflict is--above a certain threshold--inversely proportional to the understanding of the situation people have: _a little knowledge is a dangerous thing_. Being a victim on either side only exposes you to a bit of the complete picture. In fact, it actively constrains your ability to grasp the other point of view. And to those on the outside the same applies, clouding their ability to understand the thoughts and feelings of the participants.
