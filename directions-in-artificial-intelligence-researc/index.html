<meta name="description" content="Much of the early optimism about Artificial Intelligence was crushed by what is now called Moravec&#39;s Paradox: it turns out that it&#39;s often substantially harder to replicate the lower-level sensorimotor skills of humans and animals than higher reasoning tasks. Students of embodied cognition see intelligence arising from a necessary interplay with our senses taking this even further, higher-order theories of consciousness--which I&#39;ve recently become a fan of--have consciousness as a higher order layering on top of mere intelligence. Thus, we&#39;re adding a few more layers to the layer cake of supervenience (similar to what scientists often call &quot;emergence&quot;, not used in Philosophy that way because the term has been claimed by a distinct usage). I would love to see more work on complete end-to-end AI systems that have increasingly deeper levels of feedback. That&#39;s the only we&#39;ll see better AI. That and neural modelling which is getting reeeal interesting. I think I&#39;ll start posting links to some fun papers soon." />
